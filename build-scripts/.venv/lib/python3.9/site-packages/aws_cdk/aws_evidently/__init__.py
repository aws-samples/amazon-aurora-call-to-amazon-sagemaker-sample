    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::Evidently::Experiment``.

    Creates or updates an Evidently *experiment* . Before you create an experiment, you must create the feature to use for the experiment.

    An experiment helps you make feature design decisions based on evidence and data. An experiment can test as many as five variations at once. Evidently collects experiment data and analyzes it by statistical methods, and provides clear recommendations about which variations perform better.

Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can associate as many as 50 tags with an experiment.

    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::Evidently::Launch``.

    Creates or updates a *launch* of a given feature. Before you create a launch, you must create the feature to use for the launch.

    You can use a launch to safely validate new features by serving them to a specified percentage of your users while you roll out the feature. You can monitor the performance of the new feature to help you decide when to ramp up traffic to more users. This helps you reduce risk and identify unintended consequences before you fully launch the feature.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnProject``.

        :param name: The name for the project. It can include up to 127 characters.
        :param data_delivery: A structure that contains information about where Evidently is to store evaluation events for longer term storage, if you choose to do so. If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can view. You can't specify both ``CloudWatchLogs`` and ``S3Destination`` in the same operation.
        :param description: An optional description of the project.
        :param tags: Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the project. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are interpreted strictly as strings of characters. You can associate as many as 50 tags with a project. For more information, see `Tagging AWS resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`_ .
