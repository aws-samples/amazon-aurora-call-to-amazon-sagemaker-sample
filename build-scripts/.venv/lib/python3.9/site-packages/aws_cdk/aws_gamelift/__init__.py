    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::GameLift::Alias``.

    The ``AWS::GameLift::Alias`` resource creates an alias for an Amazon GameLift (GameLift) fleet destination. There are two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias displays a message instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, a terminal alias might display a URL link that directs players to an upgrade site. You can use aliases to define destinations in a game session queue or when requesting new game sessions.

        '''Create a new ``AWS::GameLift::Fleet``.

        :param scope: - scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: - scoped id of the resource.
        :param build_id: A unique identifier for a build to be deployed on the new fleet. If you are deploying the fleet with a custom game build, you must specify this property. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a ``READY`` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
        :param certificate_configuration: Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. TLS certificates are used for encrypting traffic between game clients and the game servers that are running on GameLift. By default, the ``CertificateConfiguration`` is set to ``DISABLED`` . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Note: This feature requires the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service, which is not available in all AWS regions. When working in a region that does not support this feature, a fleet creation request with certificate generation fails with a 4xx error.
        :param description: A human-readable description of the fleet.
        :param desired_ec2_instances: The number of EC2 instances that you want this fleet to host. When creating a new fleet, GameLift automatically sets this value to "1" and initiates a single instance. Once the fleet is active, update this value to trigger GameLift to add or remove instances from the fleet.
        :param ec2_inbound_permissions: The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game sessions on this fleet. If the fleet is hosting a custom game build, this property must be set before players can connect to game sessions. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift automatically sets TCP and UDP ranges.
        :param ec2_instance_type: The GameLift-supported Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all fleet instances. Instance type determines the computing resources that will be used to host your game servers, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. See `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_ for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types.
        :param fleet_type: Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, this property is set to ``ON_DEMAND`` . Learn more about when to use `On-Demand versus Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot>`_ . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created.
        :param instance_role_arn: A unique identifier for an IAM role that manages access to your AWS services. With an instance role ARN set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). Create a role or look up a role's ARN by using the `IAM dashboard <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`_ in the AWS Management Console . Learn more about using on-box credentials for your game servers at `Access external resources from a game server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-resources.html>`_ . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created.
        :param locations: A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2`` . To create a fleet with instances in the home Region only, omit this parameter.
        :param max_size: The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.
        :param metric_groups: The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time.
        :param min_size: The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.
        :param name: A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
        :param new_game_session_protection_policy: The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, this property is set to ``NoProtection`` . - *NoProtection* - Game sessions can be terminated during active gameplay as a result of a scale-down event. - *FullProtection* - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param peer_vpc_aws_account_id: Used when peering your GameLift fleet with a VPC, the unique identifier for the AWS account that owns the VPC. You can find your account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.
        :param peer_vpc_id: A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the `VPC Dashboard <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>`_ in the AWS Management Console . Learn more about VPC peering in `VPC Peering with GameLift Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`_ .
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time.
        :param runtime_configuration: Instructions for how to launch and maintain server processes on instances in the fleet. The runtime configuration defines one or more server process configurations, each identifying a build executable or Realtime script file and the number of processes of that type to run concurrently. .. epigraph:: The ``RuntimeConfiguration`` parameter is required unless the fleet is being configured using the older parameters ``ServerLaunchPath`` and ``ServerLaunchParameters`` , which are still supported for backward compatibility.
        :param script_id: The unique identifier for a Realtime configuration script to be deployed on fleet instances. You can use either the script ID or ARN. Scripts must be uploaded to GameLift prior to creating the fleet. This fleet property cannot be changed later. .. epigraph:: You can't use the ``!Ref`` command to reference a script created with a CloudFormation template for the fleet property ``ScriptId`` . Instead, use ``Fn::GetAtt Script.Arn`` or ``Fn::GetAtt Script.Id`` to retrieve either of these properties as input for ``ScriptId`` . Alternatively, enter a ``ScriptId`` string manually.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnFleet``.

        :param build_id: A unique identifier for a build to be deployed on the new fleet. If you are deploying the fleet with a custom game build, you must specify this property. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a ``READY`` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
        :param certificate_configuration: Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. TLS certificates are used for encrypting traffic between game clients and the game servers that are running on GameLift. By default, the ``CertificateConfiguration`` is set to ``DISABLED`` . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Note: This feature requires the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service, which is not available in all AWS regions. When working in a region that does not support this feature, a fleet creation request with certificate generation fails with a 4xx error.
        :param description: A human-readable description of the fleet.
        :param desired_ec2_instances: The number of EC2 instances that you want this fleet to host. When creating a new fleet, GameLift automatically sets this value to "1" and initiates a single instance. Once the fleet is active, update this value to trigger GameLift to add or remove instances from the fleet.
        :param ec2_inbound_permissions: The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game sessions on this fleet. If the fleet is hosting a custom game build, this property must be set before players can connect to game sessions. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift automatically sets TCP and UDP ranges.
        :param ec2_instance_type: The GameLift-supported Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all fleet instances. Instance type determines the computing resources that will be used to host your game servers, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity. See `Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Instance Types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/>`_ for detailed descriptions of Amazon EC2 instance types.
        :param fleet_type: Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, this property is set to ``ON_DEMAND`` . Learn more about when to use `On-Demand versus Spot Instances <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-ec2-instances.html#gamelift-ec2-instances-spot>`_ . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created.
        :param instance_role_arn: A unique identifier for an IAM role that manages access to your AWS services. With an instance role ARN set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). Create a role or look up a role's ARN by using the `IAM dashboard <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/>`_ in the AWS Management Console . Learn more about using on-box credentials for your game servers at `Access external resources from a game server <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-resources.html>`_ . This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created.
        :param locations: A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2`` . To create a fleet with instances in the home Region only, omit this parameter.
        :param max_size: The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 1.
        :param metric_groups: The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time.
        :param min_size: The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. If this parameter is not set, the default is 0.
        :param name: A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
        :param new_game_session_protection_policy: The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, this property is set to ``NoProtection`` . - *NoProtection* - Game sessions can be terminated during active gameplay as a result of a scale-down event. - *FullProtection* - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param peer_vpc_aws_account_id: Used when peering your GameLift fleet with a VPC, the unique identifier for the AWS account that owns the VPC. You can find your account ID in the AWS Management Console under account settings.
        :param peer_vpc_id: A unique identifier for a VPC with resources to be accessed by your GameLift fleet. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. To look up a VPC ID, use the `VPC Dashboard <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/>`_ in the AWS Management Console . Learn more about VPC peering in `VPC Peering with GameLift Fleets <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/vpc-peering.html>`_ .
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time.
        :param runtime_configuration: Instructions for how to launch and maintain server processes on instances in the fleet. The runtime configuration defines one or more server process configurations, each identifying a build executable or Realtime script file and the number of processes of that type to run concurrently. .. epigraph:: The ``RuntimeConfiguration`` parameter is required unless the fleet is being configured using the older parameters ``ServerLaunchPath`` and ``ServerLaunchParameters`` , which are still supported for backward compatibility.
        :param script_id: The unique identifier for a Realtime configuration script to be deployed on fleet instances. You can use either the script ID or ARN. Scripts must be uploaded to GameLift prior to creating the fleet. This fleet property cannot be changed later. .. epigraph:: You can't use the ``!Ref`` command to reference a script created with a CloudFormation template for the fleet property ``ScriptId`` . Instead, use ``Fn::GetAtt Script.Arn`` or ``Fn::GetAtt Script.Id`` to retrieve either of these properties as input for ``ScriptId`` . Alternatively, enter a ``ScriptId`` string manually.

    *This operation is used with the Amazon GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.*

    Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting. This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account , and establishes a link between the two groups. You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console. Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.

    Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:

    - An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build. For more information, see `Launching an Instance from a Launch Template <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html>`_ in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide* .
    - An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group. For more information, see `Create IAM roles for cross-service interaction <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html>`_ in the *GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide* .

    To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group. You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count. You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric.

    Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed. Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group. Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

        '''Create a new ``AWS::GameLift::GameServerGroup``.

        :param scope: - scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: - scoped id of the resource.
        :param game_server_group_name: A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.
        :param instance_definitions: The set of Amazon EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group.
        :param launch_template: The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see `Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`_ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide* . After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. .. epigraph:: If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property ``AssociatePublicIpAddress`` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
        :param role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`_ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
        :param auto_scaling_policy: Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param balancing_strategy: Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following: - ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. - ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. - ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
        :param delete_option: The type of delete to perform. To delete a game server group, specify the ``DeleteOption`` . Options include the following: - ``SAFE_DELETE`` – (default) Terminates the game server group and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group only when it has no game servers that are in ``UTILIZED`` status. - ``FORCE_DELETE`` – Terminates the game server group, including all active game servers regardless of their utilization status, and the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. - ``RETAIN`` – Does a safe delete of the game server group but retains the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group as is.
        :param game_server_protection_policy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.
        :param max_size: The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param min_size: The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param tags: A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`_ in the *AWS General Reference* . Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags, respectively. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.
        :param vpc_subnets: A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

        '''Properties for defining a ``CfnGameServerGroup``.

        :param game_server_group_name: A developer-defined identifier for the game server group. The name is unique for each Region in each AWS account.
        :param instance_definitions: The set of Amazon EC2 instance types that GameLift FleetIQ can use when balancing and automatically scaling instances in the corresponding Auto Scaling group.
        :param launch_template: The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. You can specify the template using either the template name or ID. For help with creating a launch template, see `Creating a Launch Template for an Auto Scaling Group <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/create-launch-template.html>`_ in the *Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Auto Scaling User Guide* . After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. .. epigraph:: If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property ``AssociatePublicIpAddress`` to "true". If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
        :param role_arn: The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`_ ) for an IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups.
        :param auto_scaling_policy: Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``"PercentUtilizedGameServers"`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param balancing_strategy: Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following: - ``SPOT_ONLY`` - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced. - ``SPOT_PREFERRED`` - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances. - ``ON_DEMAND_ONLY`` - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.
        :param delete_option: The type of delete to perform. To delete a game server group, specify the ``DeleteOption`` . Options include the following: - ``SAFE_DELETE`` – (default) Terminates the game server group and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group only when it has no game servers that are in ``UTILIZED`` status. - ``FORCE_DELETE`` – Terminates the game server group, including all active game servers regardless of their utilization status, and the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. - ``RETAIN`` – Does a safe delete of the game server group but retains the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group as is.
        :param game_server_protection_policy: A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.
        :param max_size: The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param min_size: The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs.
        :param tags: A list of labels to assign to the new game server group resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources is useful for resource management, access management, and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`_ in the *AWS General Reference* . Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags, respectively. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.
        :param vpc_subnets: A list of virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets to use with instances in the game server group. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

            - If player latency data is included in a game session request, destinations and locations are prioritized first based on lowest average latency (1), then on lowest hosting cost (2), then on destination list order (3), and finally on location (alphabetical) (4). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to place game sessions where average player latency is lowest, and--if latency is the same--where the hosting cost is less, etc.
            - If player latency data is not included, destinations and locations are prioritized first on destination list order (1), and then on location (alphabetical) (2). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to place game sessions on the first destination fleet listed. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session is placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically).

Each type can only be listed once. - ``LATENCY`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes locations where the average player latency (provided in each game session request) is lowest. - ``COST`` -- FleetIQ prioritizes destinations with the lowest current hosting costs.

    The ``AWS::GameLift::MatchmakingConfiguration`` resource defines a new matchmaking configuration for use with FlexMatch. Whether you're using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you're using GameLift hosting, it also defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes that are consistent with that configuration.

        '''Create a new ``AWS::GameLift::MatchmakingConfiguration``.

        :param scope: - scope in which this resource is defined.
        :param id: - scoped id of the resource.
        :param acceptance_required: A flag that determines whether a match that was created with this configuration must be accepted by the matched players. To require acceptance, set to ``TRUE`` . With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status ``REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`` to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.
        :param name: A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
        :param request_timeout_seconds: The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.
        :param rule_set_name: A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.
        :param acceptance_timeout_seconds: The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required.
        :param additional_player_count: The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param backfill_mode: The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Specify ``MANUAL`` when your game manages backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature. Specify ``AUTOMATIC`` to have GameLift create a ``StartMatchBackfill`` request whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in `Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html>`_ . Automatic backfill is not available when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param custom_event_data: Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.
        :param description: A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.
        :param flex_match_mode: Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution. - *STANDALONE* - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information, including players and team assignments, in a `MatchmakingSucceeded <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded>`_ event. - *WITH_QUEUE* - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.
        :param game_properties: A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. See `Start a Game Session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`_ . This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param game_session_data: A set of custom game session properties, formatted as a single string value. This data is passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. See `Start a Game Session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`_ . This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param game_session_queue_arns: The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`_ ) that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` . Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` , do not set this parameter.
        :param notification_target: An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See `Setting up notifications for matchmaking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-notification.html>`_ for more information.
        :param tags: A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`_ in the *AWS General Reference* .

With this option enabled, matchmaking tickets use the status ``REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE`` to indicate when a completed potential match is waiting for player acceptance.
        :param name: A unique identifier for the matchmaking configuration. This name is used to identify the configuration associated with a matchmaking request or ticket.
        :param request_timeout_seconds: The maximum duration, in seconds, that a matchmaking ticket can remain in process before timing out. Requests that fail due to timing out can be resubmitted as needed.
        :param rule_set_name: A unique identifier for the matchmaking rule set to use with this configuration. You can use either the rule set name or ARN value. A matchmaking configuration can only use rule sets that are defined in the same Region.
        :param acceptance_timeout_seconds: The length of time (in seconds) to wait for players to accept a proposed match, if acceptance is required.
        :param additional_player_count: The number of player slots in a match to keep open for future players. For example, if the configuration's rule set specifies a match for a single 12-person team, and the additional player count is set to 2, only 10 players are selected for the match. This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param backfill_mode: The method used to backfill game sessions that are created with this matchmaking configuration. Specify ``MANUAL`` when your game manages backfill requests manually or does not use the match backfill feature. Specify ``AUTOMATIC`` to have GameLift create a ``StartMatchBackfill`` request whenever a game session has one or more open slots. Learn more about manual and automatic backfill in `Backfill Existing Games with FlexMatch <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-backfill.html>`_ . Automatic backfill is not available when ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param custom_event_data: Information to add to all events related to the matchmaking configuration.
        :param description: A descriptive label that is associated with matchmaking configuration.
        :param flex_match_mode: Indicates whether this matchmaking configuration is being used with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking solution. - *STANDALONE* - FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information, including players and team assignments, in a `MatchmakingSucceeded <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-events.html#match-events-matchmakingsucceeded>`_ event. - *WITH_QUEUE* - FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.
        :param game_properties: A set of custom properties for a game session, formatted as key-value pairs. These properties are passed to a game server process with a request to start a new game session. See `Start a Game Session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`_ . This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .

See `Start a Game Session <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-sdk-server-api.html#gamelift-sdk-server-startsession>`_ . This parameter is not used if ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` .
        :param game_session_queue_arns: The Amazon Resource Name ( `ARN <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/s3-arn-format.html>`_ ) that is assigned to a GameLift game session queue resource and uniquely identifies it. ARNs are unique across all Regions. Format is ``arn:aws:gamelift:<region>::gamesessionqueue/<queue name>`` . Queues can be located in any Region. Queues are used to start new GameLift-hosted game sessions for matches that are created with this matchmaking configuration. If ``FlexMatchMode`` is set to ``STANDALONE`` , do not set this parameter.
        :param notification_target: An SNS topic ARN that is set up to receive matchmaking notifications. See `Setting up notifications for matchmaking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/flexmatchguide/match-notification.html>`_ for more information.
        :param tags: A list of labels to assign to the new matchmaking configuration resource. Tags are developer-defined key-value pairs. Tagging AWS resources are useful for resource management, access management and cost allocation. For more information, see `Tagging AWS Resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html>`_ in the *AWS General Reference* . Once the resource is created, you can use TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource to add, remove, and view tags. The maximum tag limit may be lower than stated. See the AWS General Reference for actual tagging limits.

    Creates a new rule set for FlexMatch matchmaking. A rule set describes the type of match to create, such as the number and size of teams. It also sets the parameters for acceptable player matches, such as minimum skill level or character type.

    To create a matchmaking rule set, provide unique rule set name and the rule set body in JSON format. Rule sets must be defined in the same Region as the matchmaking configuration they are used with.

    Since matchmaking rule sets cannot be edited, it is a good idea to check the rule set syntax.
