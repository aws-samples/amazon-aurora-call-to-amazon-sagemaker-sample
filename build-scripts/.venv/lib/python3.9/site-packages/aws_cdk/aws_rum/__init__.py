    '''A CloudFormation ``AWS::RUM::AppMonitor``.

    Creates a CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which you can use to collect telemetry data from your application and send it to CloudWatch RUM. The data includes performance and reliability information such as page load time, client-side errors, and user behavior.

    After you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console to get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application. For more information, see `How do I find a code snippet that I've already generated? <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-RUM-find-code-snippet.html>`_

Cookies are stored in the top-level domain of the current page.

            :param session_sample_rate: Specifies the portion of user sessions to use for CloudWatch RUM data collection. Choosing a higher portion gives you more data but also incurs more costs. The range for this value is 0 to 1 inclusive. Setting this to 1 means that 100% of user sessions are sampled, and setting it to 0.1 means that 10% of user sessions are sampled. If you omit this parameter, the default of 0.1 is used, and 10% of sessions will be sampled.
            :param telemetries: An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app monitor is to collect. - ``errors`` indicates that RUM collects data about unhandled JavaScript errors raised by your application. - ``performance`` indicates that RUM collects performance data about how your application and its resources are loaded and rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals. - ``http`` indicates that RUM collects data about HTTP errors thrown by your application.
